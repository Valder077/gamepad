# Suhansh's Hackpad
## Description 
This is my personal take on a macropad, catered for the games I play, which include Fortnite and Valorant, featuring WASD keys and a dedicated button(crouching or anything you want to be honest). It also includes a rotary encoder that adjusts the system's volume, providing quick audio control, in the minimalistic set up which is compact and functional, hence enhancing my personal gaming experience.

## Challenges
I think they key challenge with building this macropad was the fact that I am new to hardware so the entire process of building this took quite a lot of googling and asking around for help but I am proud of where this project ended up.
